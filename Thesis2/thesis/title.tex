\textsc{Declaration of Originality}

\medskip

\noindent
This thesis was collaboratively authored by an ensemble of my favourite language models. They solemnly swear that all cited sources were duly prompted, no unauthorized URLs were consulted, and no hallucinating interns were harmed in the making of this document. Any remaining typos are left in to prove a human was supervising.
