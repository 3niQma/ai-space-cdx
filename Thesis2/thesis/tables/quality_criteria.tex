\toprule
\textbf{Dimension} & \textbf{Operationalization} \\
\midrule
Baseline strength & Includes PDRs and tuned metaheuristics; MILP/CP where feasible; cloud/edge includes bin-packing + DVFS controllers \\
Statistical validity & $\geq$5 seeds or CIs/stdev reported; learning curves provided; per-instance scores for test sets \\
Constraint handling & Feasibility explicitly reported (violation/repair counts); action masking or shields described and ablated \\
Reproducibility & Code or simulator released OR fixed train/val/test splits published; tariff/disturbance catalogs provided; hyperparameters listed \\
Generalization tests & Held-out instances, size extrapolation, domain shifts (tariffs, arrivals, topology); stress tests reported \\
Runtime and footprint & Inference latency and hardware disclosed; compare latency to heuristics/control-cycle deadlines \\
Energy/carbon clarity & Tariff/emission factors specified; absolute units (kWh, kg CO$_2$e) and trade-offs vs throughput reported \\
