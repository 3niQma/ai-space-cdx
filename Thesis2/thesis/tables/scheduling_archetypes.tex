\textbf{Problem class} & \textbf{Typical assumptions} & \textbf{Common constraints} & \textbf{RL design implications} \\
\midrule
Job Shop (JSS) & Fixed routing, unit machines & Precedence, machine capacity, due dates & Disjunctive-graph state, masking for machine availability and precedence \\
Flexible Job Shop (FJSS) & Alternative machines per operation & Routing choice, setups, re-entrance & Joint routing/dispatch actions; masks couple routing with feasibility; graph encoders \\
Flow/Hybrid Flow Shop & Stage-wise flow, parallel machines per stage & Blocking/no-wait, buffers, sequence-dependent setups & Stage-wise masking; idle/hold actions; penalty terms for blocking \\
Parallel/Batch Machines & Identical/unrelated machines, batching allowed & Batch size, family setups, release dates & Batch-construction action spaces; reward terms for batch balance vs.\ tardiness \\
Dynamic/Online & Job arrivals, stochastic times & Rolling horizon, response-time SLAs & Recurrent/attention states; warm-started value functions; disturbance-aware masking \\
Transport/AGV & Coupled routing and processing & Collision/zone safety, charging windows & Multi-agent or joint action spaces; safety shields for headway/charge \\
