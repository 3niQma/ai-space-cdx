Technique & Examples & Notes \\\hline
Action masking & Feasible machines/operations only; block violating routes & Stabilizes training, keeps feasibility; used in JSS/FJSS and constrained routing \\
Penalty shaping & Add cost for lateness, setups, energy overuse, SLA violation & Simple to implement; may struggle with hard constraints if penalties mis-tuned \\
Shields/filters & Safety layer vetoes unsafe actions (collisions, overruns) & Effective for safety-critical transport/production; requires rule base \\
Lagrangian/dual & Penalty multipliers updated during training & Better balance feasibility vs performance; needs tuning \\
Curricula & Start relaxed, tighten constraints over training & Improves learning stability under heavy constraints \\
