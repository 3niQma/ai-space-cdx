\toprule
\textbf{Suite / source} & \textbf{Scale / features} & \textbf{What it probes} & \textbf{RL usage notes} \\
\midrule
FT06/10/20, LA & Small--medium JSS & Dispatch quality, makespan gap to optimum & Masks guarantee feasibility; useful for ablations and gap-to-optimum reporting \\
Taillard (tai20--100) & Medium--large JSS/FJSS & Cross-size generalization, scalability & Popular for train/val/test splits; supports curriculum from small to large \\
BRdata / OR-Lib & FJSS with alternate machines & Routing/dispatch coupling & Good for testing routing masks and dual-attention encoders \\
Dynamic JSS generators & Arrival bursts, stochastic times & Robustness to non-stationarity & Enables stress suites with downtime and rush orders \\
AGV/warehouse layouts (bespoke) & Multi-AGV, collisions, charging & Safety and multi-agent coordination & Requires shields/masks; latency constraints matter \\
Port/yard traces & Trucks, cranes, energy tariffs & Sim-to-real signal quality & Real traces for domain randomization; compare to rule-based dispatch \\
Cloud traces (Google, Alibaba) & Heterogeneous jobs, deadlines & SLA, energy bins, resource fragmentation & Supports batch/offline RL; admission and bin packing baselines needed \\
Edge/IoT toy suites & Small graphs, limited compute & Decision latency under constraints & Useful for profiling policy runtime vs.\ heuristics \\
